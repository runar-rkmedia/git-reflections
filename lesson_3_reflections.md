#### When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I can easily share my code with others, collaborate and it serves as a backup to my local repository. I can even edit and add files from any computer

#### Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since commits are meant to be of just a single logical change, and often not a complete function for the end-user, pushing every commit wouldn't be meeningful as it would add code that might not be used, not tested, and even knowingly not working.

If the changes are big enought that one would want to share them, one can easily push.
