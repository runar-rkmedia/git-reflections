#### What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes git keep track of my files. I need it to make git track this project.

#### How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It serves as a middlepoint. Say that I made some changes to multiple files, and then realized that the changes should be in multiple commits instead of just one. I can then stage just a few files, and then commit them. Next I'll add the other ones and commit them seperately in a tidy way.

This keeps my repository clean and tidy, so I can easily know which commit does what.
